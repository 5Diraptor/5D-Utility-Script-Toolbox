# 5D Utility Script Toolbox

Here's a bunch of scripts I use a lot, and happy to share them.  They're general utilities for managing and sorting media files such as images, videos and audio.
Hope this helps!

These are built for Windows OS, and heavily relies on ffmpeg and imagemagick.  You can install them here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
